   # My very first webpage.
   
   Welcome !
   
  This is a README file about this little project.
  
  In the first module we learned to build a HTML website.
  
  HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language,
  a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, 
  colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
  
  In the second module we learned to use CSS to give Design to our HTML.
  
  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
  CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,
  paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. 
  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
  
  In the third module we learned how to use Git and GitHub.
  
  The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files,
  as they change over time.
  Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository. 
  A git repository contains, 
  among other things, the following: A set of commit objects.
  
  GitHub is an American company that provides 
  hosting for software development version control using Git. ... 
  It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) 
  functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
  
  We used GitHub to store our project on it,
  then we learned how to "host" our website on GitHub.
  
  Thank you for reading our README file .
  
  HAVE A NICE DAY !
